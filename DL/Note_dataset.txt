Note that for the deep learning framework, we could not share all of the data that was used in our paper, because for this framework, the networks are stored as weighted adjacency matrices. Because of this, and because of the large number of the networks, the entire data is way too large (over 4GB) to be stored on our web server. We are happy to share all of the data in an alternative way upon email request.
